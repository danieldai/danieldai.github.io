# Welcome to DaniDai.com!

DaniDai.com is powered by Pelican, a static site generaotr written in Python. As the contents of GitHub Pages for user must be on `master` branch, so I put the source code of this blog on another branch named `source`. Whenever I do any changes to the contents of the blog, I check out the `source` branch, edit the markdown files, regenerate the content and output the content to `master` branch with `ghp-import`
