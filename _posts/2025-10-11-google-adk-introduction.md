# Google ADK Introduction - Getting Started with Agent Development Kit

The Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a powerful framework for building AI agents using large language models. Whether you're creating simple chatbots or complex multi-agent systems, ADK provides the tools and infrastructure needed to develop, test, and deploy intelligent agents.

## What is Google ADK?

The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is Google's comprehensive framework for building AI agents. It provides:

- **Agent Framework**: Tools for creating LLM-powered agents
- **Multi-tool Support**: Integration with various tools and APIs
- **Web Interface**: Built-in UI for testing and interacting with agents
- **Command-line Tools**: CLI for development and deployment
- **Cloud Integration**: Easy deployment to Google Cloud Platform
- **Python & Java Support**: Available in both programming languages

## Key Components

### 1. Agent Framework
The core ADK framework provides the foundation for building AI agents:

- **LLM Agents**: Create agents powered by large language models
- **Workflow Agents**: Build sequential, loop, and parallel agent workflows
- **Multi-agent Systems**: Coordinate multiple agents working together
- **Custom Agents**: Extend functionality with custom agent implementations

### 2. Tools Integration
ADK supports various types of tools for agent functionality:

- **Function Tools**: Custom Python/Java functions
- **Built-in Tools**: Pre-built utility tools
- **Google Cloud Tools**: Integration with Google Cloud services
- **OpenAPI Tools**: Connect to REST APIs
- **MCP Tools**: Model Context Protocol integration

### 3. Development Environment
ADK provides multiple ways to develop and test agents:

- **Command-line Interface**: Interactive CLI for agent testing
- **Web Interface**: Built-in web UI for agent interaction
- **Local Development**: Run agents locally for testing
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy to Google Cloud Platform

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before diving into agent development with ADK, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.9 or later**: Required for Python ADK
- **pip**: Package installer for Python
- **Google API Key**: For accessing Gemini models
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux

### Installation Steps

1. **Install ADK**
   ```bash
   pip install google-adk
   ```

2. **Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Create Your First Agent Project**
   ```bash
   adk create my_agent
   ```

4. **Set Up API Key**
   ```bash
   echo 'GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"' > .env
   ```

## Essential Tools and Commands

### ADK CLI Commands
The ADK command-line interface provides essential tools for agent development:

```bash
# Create a new agent project
adk create my_agent

# Run agent with command-line interface
adk run my_agent

# Start web interface for agent testing
adk web --port 8000 my_agent

# Deploy agent to cloud
adk deploy my_agent
```

### Basic Agent Implementation
Here's a simple agent example using the ADK framework:

```python
from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import Agent

# Mock tool implementation
def get_current_time(city: str) -> dict:
    """Returns the current time in a specified city."""
    return {"status": "success", "city": city, "time": "10:30 AM"}

root_agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.5-flash',
    name='root_agent',
    description="Tells the current time in a specified city.",
    instruction="You are a helpful assistant that tells the current time in cities. Use the 'get_current_time' tool for this purpose.",
    tools=[get_current_time],
)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Project Structure
Organize your ADK agent project with a clear structure:

```
my_agent/
â”œâ”€â”€ agent.py          # Main agent code
â”œâ”€â”€ .env              # API keys and configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py       # Python package initialization
â”œâ”€â”€ tools/            # Custom tools directory
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ custom_tools.py
â””â”€â”€ tests/            # Test files
    â””â”€â”€ test_agent.py
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Properly manage your environment variables:

```bash
# .env file
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
PROJECT_ID="your_project_id"
```

### 3. Agent Design Patterns
Follow these patterns for robust agent development:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each agent should have a clear, focused purpose
- **Tool Integration**: Use appropriate tools for specific tasks
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and fallbacks
- **Testing**: Test agents with various inputs and scenarios

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### 1. API Key Issues
- **Problem**: Agent fails to authenticate with Google APIs
- **Solution**: Verify API key in `.env` file and ensure proper permissions

### 2. Model Selection
- **Problem**: Choosing the right model for your use case
- **Solution**: Start with `gemini-2.5-flash` for general use, upgrade to `gemini-2.5-pro` for complex tasks

### 3. Tool Integration
- **Problem**: Tools not working as expected
- **Solution**: Check tool function signatures and return types

### 4. Deployment Issues
- **Problem**: Agent fails to deploy to cloud
- **Solution**: Verify Google Cloud credentials and project configuration
