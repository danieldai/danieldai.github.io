## Experiences

As a Software developer, I have a technical experience from bottom up.

### Embedded Software Engineer

At first, I developed with the lowest level in software domain of a computer, bootloader, Linux kernel and drivers. I was working for a telecom company at that time, to develop Fiber communication devices, which is called `Embedded devices`. Before I join the team, VxWorks is used, I introduced `Embedded Linux` into the team to replace VxWorks, and managed to migrate the whole team and existing apps to `Embbeded Linux`.

### VoIP Software Engineer

Later, I moved a level up, the application domain, but still on `embedded devices`. At that time, I developed an application that behaves as an gateway between ondinary telephone and the VoIP(Voice over Internet Protocal) server.

### Test System Developer

After that, I joined a team that develops `Embedded Linux Distribute`, I made a auto test system for the team, this auto test system is built on Buildbot, it compiles the whole Linux image for different targets e.g. MIPS, PowerPC, ARM, runs the image on corresponding target hardware, and collect, store results.

This time, I did most of my work in Python, compared with previous works in C, a layer up again. And the auto test system has a Web based Interface, I begain to have some experience in HTTP, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### CDN System Developer

`CDN` is short for `Content Delivery Network`. It's used to speed up delivering of web pages, video and other files from server to end user's devices.Everytime Apple release a new version iOS, CDN plays a key role in deliverying iOS image to millions of devices.

I was in a team that was reseaching `Mobile Network Delivery Optimization`, which is fousing on making our experience with mobile network feels faster. It was a small team, and it's a fantastic experience working in the team.

### Web Backend Developer

Now I'm a Web backend developer using Django in a startup mobile health care company. I'm the main developer in backend. And I'm also involed in some iOS app development.
